# Equal Weight S&P 500
The S&P 500 is the world's most popular stock market index. The largest fund that is benchmarked to this index is the SPDR® S&P 500® ETF Trust. It has more than US$250 billion of assets under management.

The goal of this project is to create a Python script that will accept the value of your portfolio and tell you how many shares of each S&P 500 constituent you should purchase to get an equal-weight version of the index fund.
